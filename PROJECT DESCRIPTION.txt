Hello,

I hope you are well!!

This a brief description of what I did in the assessment project!!


*** PROJECT DESCRIPTION ***
- The user will load the app, data will be fetched and displayed in a table. 
- The user is able to filter the data based on the checkboxes they click. 
- They will only see the data that corresponds to their checkbox selection and what they type in the search box.
- Data is fetched in the BankContainer component and passed to the Table component as a prop and displayed to the user.
- This project was built from scratch with no 3rd party table libraries.
- Functional components used instead of Class components.
- Hook (useEffect) was used in place of lifecycle method.
- Fetch operation achieved using react inbuilt fetch API.

*** TECHNOLOGIES USED ***
1. React.Js - Used to build the whole UI
2. Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet (Sass) - Used to style the UI
3. Json-Server - Used to facilitate data fetching. It was used to create demo REST JSON services within a short span of minutes.

*** PROJECT DELIVERABLES ***
- All project deliverables as described in the project's README.md were delivered.

*** SETUP ***

- Run yarn/npm install in your terminal to download dependencies
